> ### Code Exercise 01: Event Handlers
> This code provides the following:<br>
Two (2) columns (ListBoxes), The ability to enter items into a form that in turn sends that data back to the appropriate list (using a custom event handler).
The ability for the user to move an item between the columns. The ability for the user to delete an individual item from both columns. The ability for the user to edit an individual item from either column.
The ability for the user to save a list that can be loaded back into the app. The ability to load the saved list back into the app. The ability to save the list in a format that the user can print and hand to someone.

> Load List, Save List (As XML data), Print List, and Exit.  A mechanism allowing the user to load the apps list data. An Exit command to gracefully quit the application

> All menu commands have appropriate shortcut keys (CTRL+L, CTRL+S, CTRL+Q)

> ### Code Exercise 02: Database Connectivity
> This application contains a database. The application passes information to and from the database, ie: the database updates when the ListView is updated. It has the ability to add new records. Each of the fields is also validated. (Names cannot contain numbers and number fields cannot contain letters.) Icon (ImageList) are assigned to each record. The user can edit individual records as well as delete individual records. The user can has the ability to move through the records and lastly the user can save the records as a list that can be printed.
